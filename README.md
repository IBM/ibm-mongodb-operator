# ibm-mongodb-operator

The `ibm-mongodb-operator` operator is built to support the IBM Cloud Platform Common Services. It stands up a mongoDB database that is shared by the services within IBM Cloud Platform Common Services.

## Supported platforms

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.2 or newer installed on one of the following platforms:

   - Linux x86_64
   - Linux on Power (ppc64le)
   - Linux on IBM Z and LinuxONE

## Operator versions

| Version | Date | Details |
| ----- | ---- | ----------------- |
| 1.1.0 | July 2020 | Allow users to configure their own admin secret </br> - The CSV defines dependencies that it has to run
| 1.0.0 | March 2020 | Initial Offering of MongoDB operator

## Prerequisites

Before you install this operator, you need to first install the operator dependencies and prerequisites:

- For the list of operator dependencies, see the IBM Knowledge Center [Common Services dependencies documentation](http://ibm.biz/cpcs_opdependencies).

- For the list of prerequisites for installing the operator, see the IBM Knowledge Center [Preparing to install services documentation](http://ibm.biz/cpcs_opinstprereq).

## Documentation

To install the operator with the IBM Common Services Operator follow the installation and configuration instructions within the IBM Knowledge Center.

- If you are using the operator as part of an IBM Cloud Pak, see the documentation for that IBM Cloud Pak. For a list of IBM Cloud Paks, see [IBM Cloud Paks that use Common Services](http://ibm.biz/cpcs_cloudpaks).
- If you are using the operator with an IBM Containerized Software, see the IBM Cloud Platform Common Services Knowledge Center [Installer documentation](http://ibm.biz/cpcs_opinstall).

## SecurityContextConstraints Requirements

The IBM Common Services MongoDB service supports running with the OpenShift Container Platform 4.3 default restricted Security Context Constraints (SCCs).

Custom SecurityContextConstraints definition:

```
allowHostDirVolumePlugin: false
allowHostIPC: false
allowHostNetwork: false
allowHostPID: false
allowHostPorts: false
allowPrivilegeEscalation: true
allowPrivilegedContainer: false
allowedCapabilities: null

      pods to be run with a UID, and SELinux context that are allocated to the namespace.  This
      is the most restrictive SCC and it is used by default for authenticated users.

### Key Features

**_Admin Secret_**

Starting with version 1.1.0, you can now supply your own `icp-mongodb-admin` secret. The secret must have a `user` field and a `password` field and be in the same namespace where mongoDB is going to be created. If you choose not to supply a secret, a random user and password will be created and used. The `icp-mongodb-admin` secret will persist after uninstalling or removing the MongoDB custom resource so that uninstall and re-install are possible by using the same Persistent Volumes.

Example YAML for creating your own admin secret before installation. The user and password are base64 encrypted.
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: icp-mongodb-admin
  namespace: ibm-common-services
type: Opaque
data:
  password: SFV6a2NYMkdKa2tBZA==
  user: dGpOcDR5Unc=
```

### Notes

This is designed for use by IBM Common Services only.

The operator does not support updating the CR in version 1.0.0. To make changes to a deployed MongoDB instance, it is best to directly edit the statefulset.

When you deploy MongoDB, it is better to use 3 replicas, especially if you are not backing up your data. It is possible for the data to be corrupted and recovering from a 3-replica deployment is much easier.
